## Hello, World!

My name is Ivana Karcelova, and this is my **[about]**(../About)** page.*

For a more detailed page, check out my **[resume]**(../resume)** !*

## School
Currently, I am a Junior at Rutgers Preparatory School.

This year, I am taking AP Computer Science!

### Clubs
I am a leader of my school's *Gender Equality Movement Club*, take part in the *Computing Club*, and

am a delegate in the *North American Invitational Model United Nations*

## Programs
As an aspiring Software Engineer, I take part in many out-of-school programs. Here is a short list of what I do in my free time:
- _Girls Who Code_
  {Throughout 2017 and 2018, I took part in a local Girls Who Code club. While there, I developed my programming skills, learned JavaScript,
    built a website, and met an empowering group of women!}
- _Kode with Klossy_
  {This past summer, I received the Kode with Klossy Scholarship and took part in the Level 3 camp in New York City. The camp ran for
    two weeks, and I learned the majority of how to code in Swift.}
- _#BUILTBYGIRLS Wave Program_
  { Since 2017, I have taken part in #BUILTBYGIRLS' WAVE advisory program. Through that progam, I have been able to }
- _Junior Academy Challenges_
  { In the Junior Academy, I took part in the Sustainable Consumption challenge and developed a prototype filter for grey water.
    Through the program, I met with girls from all over the world, and we eventually won the *SIAP Project* award!}

## Volunteering and Work
Aside from Computer Science and the Arts, I also volunteer and work.

### _Volunteer_
This past summer, I volunteered at the *Europe Schools* in my hometown of Petrich, Bulgaria. I helped prepare a group of students for their
upcoming _Cambridge Language Exam_, in English. I taught them test taking tips, and made them more comfortable in the speaking part of the language.

I also regularly tutor Elementary and Middle schoolers at my local church. We meet several times throughout the week, and  I mostly help middle schoolers with their Science and Math projects and assignments.

### _Work_
Currently, I am an Intern at *Trip of a Lifetime*, a nonprofit organization that gives underprivileged High School students their own _trip of a lifetime_. I have spent the past summer revamping their website for their Summer Teen Tours Program.

## Awards
A list of awards I have received through the years:
- _SIAP Project Award_
{For my _Sustainable Consumption_ project for Junior Academy, my group and I developed a filter for grey water. From there, I created a video
  that compiled our work, and eventually, we won the SIAP Project Award. Our video was presented at the annual _*New York STEM Alliance*_ summit}
- _NCWIT_
{ I received an _*Honorable Mention*_ award for my excellence in Computer Science from the National Center for Women and Information Technology.
