For a more detailed page, check out my **[resumé](../resume)**

## School
Currently, I am a _Junior_ at Rutgers Preparatory School.🏫

This year, I am taking AP Computer Science!💻

### Clubs
I am a leader of my school's *Gender Equality Movement Club*✊, take part in the *Computing Club* 💻, and

am a delegate at the *North American Invitational Model United Nations*💼

## Programs
As an aspiring Software Engineer, I take part in many out-of-school programs. Here is a short list of what I do in my free time:
- _Girls Who Code_👯

  { Throughout 2017 and 2018, I took part in a local _Girls Who Code_ club. While there, I developed my programming skills, learned JavaScript,
    built a website, and met an empowering group of women! }
- _Kode with Klossy_🖥

  { This past summer, I received the _Kode with Klossy_ Scholarship and took part in the Level 3 camp in New York City. The camp ran for
    two weeks, and I learned the majority of how to code in Swift. }

## Volunteering and Work
Aside from Computer Science and the Arts, I also volunteer and work.

### _Volunteer_
This past summer, I volunteered at the *Europe Schools* in my hometown of Petrich, Bulgaria. I helped prepare a group of students for their
upcoming _Cambridge Language Exam_, in English. I taught them test taking tips, and made them more comfortable in the speaking part of the language.📚

I also regularly tutor Elementary and Middle schoolers at my local church. We meet several times throughout the week, and  I mostly help middle schoolers with their Science and Math projects and assignments.✏️

### _Work_
Currently, I am an Intern at *Trip of a Lifetime*, a nonprofit organization that gives underprivileged High School students their own _trip of a lifetime_. I have spent the past summer revamping their website for their Summer Teen Tours Program.💻✈️
