## Hello, World!

My name is Ivana Karcelova, and this is my **[about]**(../About)** page.*

## School
Currently, I am a Junior at Rutgers Preparatory School.

This year, I am taking AP Computer Science!

### Clubs
I am a leader of my school's *Gender Equality Movement Club*, take part in the *Computing Club*, and

am a delegate in the *North American Invitational Model United Nations*

As an aspiring Software Engineer, I take part in many out-of-school programs. Here is a short list of what I do in my free time:

## Volunteering and Work
Aside from Computer Science and the Arts, I also volunteer and work.

### _Volunteer_
This past summer, I volunteered at the *Europe Schools* in my hometown of Petrich, Bulgaria. I helped prepare a group of students for their
upcoming _Cambridge Language Exam_, in English. I taught them test taking tips, and made them more comfortable in the speaking part of the language.

I also regularly tutor Elementary and Middle schoolers at my local church. We meet several times throughout the week, and  I mostly help middle schoolers with their Science and Math projects and assignments.

### _Work_
Currently, I am an Intern at *Trip of a Lifetime*, a nonprofit organization that gives underprivileged High School students their own _trip of a lifetime_. I have spent the past summer revamping their website for their Summer Teen Tours Program.
